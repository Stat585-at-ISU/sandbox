# The Tale of the Lovely Dirac


For as long as it was remembered Dirac knew that it was different. What's different?
I don't know.
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up in a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:


Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Once upon a time,

After he staying at Iowa for 10 dates, he begin to hate winter!


It liked eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and for that it was an outcast, as God intended. 

Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Dogs are better lets be honest 

Joe :heart: Dirac distribution


He always wishes summer could come back sooner.


He was looking forward to making more friends.

He was fired by his boss. So he would have no income to support his family--his wife and six children. He reminded himself to be stronger. But his tear could not be stopped.

To make a change, he went to the job market. But he was too old and there was no suitable job for him. Dirac didn't know how to do it.
