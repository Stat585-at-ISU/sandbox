# The Tale of the Lovely Dirac


For as long as it was remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up in a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:


Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Once upon a time,



It liked eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and for that it was an outcast, as God intended. 

Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Dogs are better lets be honest 

Joe :heart: Dirac distribution


He always wishes summer could come back sooner.

He was looking forward to making more friends.
