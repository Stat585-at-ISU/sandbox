# The Tale of the Lovely Dirac


For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different. Dirac's parents left him while he was in a very young age. Dirac did not remember their names or faces.
Dirac was in the woods then a mushroom-looking creature appeared to accompany Dirac. 
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up in a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:

Dirac went to his office and tried to find it again. 

Long long long ago,...

He lived in a high mountain. He had a big beard.

It dreamed of having a family - lots of the functions it knew had their own family. There were the Uniforms and the Poissons, the Exponentials and everpresent Normals, who claimed that they were related to pretty much everybody. Dirac sighed, and shouldered its backpack to go to school.

The snow was heavy.

What's different?
I don't know.

Once upon a time, a smart boy lives in the dark city. He loves the sun and hate of snow.

He always wishes summer could come back sooner.

Meow Meow Cats are the best! :heart:
Dogs are better lets be honest 

Joe :heart: Dirac distribution

Once upon a time,

It liked eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and for that it was an outcast, as God intended. 


Did I do it right?

surprise

D-I-R-A-C oh boy!


Life is short, do something.

He was fired by his boss. So he would have no income to support his family--his wife and six children. He reminded himself to be stronger. But his tear could not be stopped.

To make a change, he went to the job market. But he was too old and there was no suitable job for him. Dirac didn't know how to do it.

^_^

I do not know what to add to my storyline at this time!
Just playing around with the stuff.


One day Dirac decided to get a pet cat.

Who is Dirac? Who am I? What am I doing here?
I see all these people but they don't see me.
