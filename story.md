# The Tale of the Lonely Dirac

For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
It knew a lot of functions and even some distributions, but it wasn't really close to any of them.
It dreamed of having a family - lots of the functions it knew had their own family. There were the Uniforms and the Poissons, the Exponentials and everpresent NOrmals, who claimed that they were related to pretty much everybody. Dirac sighed, and shouldered its backpack to got to school.
